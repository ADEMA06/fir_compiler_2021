# fir_compiler_2021

This repository consists in a project done for the Compilers subject in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (2020/2021). The idea behind this project was making a functional compiler based upon the rules and syntaxes defined by our teacher.

This project was done in collaboration with [@ruibferreira](https://github.com/ruibferreira).
