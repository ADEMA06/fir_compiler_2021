# fir_compiler_2021

This repository consists in a project done for the Compilers subject in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (2020/2021). The idea behind this project was making a functional compiler based upon the rules and syntaxes defined by our teacher.

This project was done in collaboration with [@ruibferreira](https://github.com/ruibferreira).

> **Note**: In order to compile the code, some additional libraries are required, however they were made by our teacher for the execution of this project, and since they were copyrighted and I don't intend to get into trouble, I've decided to omit them. Thank you for understanding.
